# Odin Recipes

This project was created as a part of The Odin Project's Foundations course to practice building a simple recipe website using only basic HTML. It contains a main index page which has links to 3 recipes. The recipes were curated from Allrecipes' website for educational purposes only. The project can be improved by introducing a link to the home page (index.html) from the individual recipe pages.
